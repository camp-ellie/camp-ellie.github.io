    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a college basketball simulator. By taking statistics from every possession played in the 2024 NCAA Men's college basketball season, probabilities for teams were caluclated and can be used in a possession by possession simulation. The work for making the simulation is split up into a few parts. These parts can be broken down into the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Collection\n",
    "2. Data Processing \n",
    "3. Statistical Analysis\n",
    "4. Simulating Games\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection step consists of reading in information from play-by-play data. This is necessary because the simulation attempts to simulate a game by estimating the result of each possession between two teams. In order to get accurate data for each team's possession results, play-by-play data is parsed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data processing step takes the collected data and prepares it to be used in the statistical analysis step. The raw data originally collected is interesting to look at, but not very useful in any kind of data science sense. It consists of season level data to look at how teams compare to each other over the course of the whole season, and game level data used to see how individual teams compared in a head to head matchup. The data processing step mainly looks at the game level data. It uses an arbitrary data that is around halfway into the season, and compiles the sum of the data before that point. For every game after that date, it updates the sum of the previous game stats, and also notes the stats from the current game. The data is then altered so that instead of listing how many possession results occured in the game, a row for each possession is included in the dataset. This makes the result categorical, so that it can be more easily analyzed in the next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical analysis step is relatively simlpe. A multinomial logistic regression is performed on the data. The regression takes the offense's and defense's previous probabilities as inputs, and tries to come up with the probability for every possession result. This is done with SciKitLearn's LogisticRegression class. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the statistical analysis is concluded, there is now a model that can take two teams' possession probabilities, and come up with expected results for their possessions. These probabilities are fed into a simulation which simulates a game possession by possession. Many of these games are simulated, their results are all listed, as well as their average score."

    "### Core data collection loop\n",
    "The loop to collect all of the data is rather simple due to having so many helper functions. The play-by-play data is read into a pandas dataframe from a csv file. As the file consists of many games listed one after another, the pandas groupby() function is used to look at each individual game by game_id. When looking at an individual game, the home team and away team is determined. The teams, as well as dictionaries ready to hold their stats are passed to the handle_game function. The handle_game function returns those updated dictionaries, and they are passed to the update_stat_list and update_opp_list functions. After reading through the whole game, the game date and each team's possession statistics are recorded in the result_list array. After doing this for the whole dataset, the team_stat_list and team_opp_list dictionaries contains every team's season statistics."

This project uses input data of a team's offensive capabilities (measured by their percentage of possessions that end in missed shots, two-point shots, three-point shots, offensive rebounds, turnovers, and fouls), and another team's defensive capabilities (measured by the same results). By running a multinomial regression on a team's offense and team's defense, probabilities for the team's offensive possession ending in one of those results are calculated. "
